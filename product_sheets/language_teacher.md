# Product sheet: Language teacher

Let's practice our language skills!

Language students often have a theoretical understanding of
grammar and vocabulary but lack sufficient opportunities
to apply this knowledge in authentic, real-time conversations.

Provide an interface that lets a student select a language
and initiate a conversation via text message. The AI will then
engage in a chat conversation with the student in the student's
chosen language.

A student may choose to receive a score and evaluation. For this,
the student can ask for an evaluation, effectively ending the
conversation. He will then receive a report card that also contains
specific mistakes the user made.
You may also want to add additional learning modes (e.g. ask the AI
to send the reply in the target language and in English).
